Session 4, Project Goals

Define application goals:
    The overall goal is to to pull historical temperature data from API server and use them to generate line graphs.
    Data Source: open-meteo.com API weather data
    Data Storage: Panda dataframes within the program and CSV files on the local hard drive.
    Data Utilization: matplotlib graphs showing historical patterns and changes.

Test functionality of handler, mocked service and API-calling service with print statements:
    Using the example program from the open-meteo.com I was able to pull temperature data for the past 2 weeks and create a line graph demonstrating functionality.

Files used to demonstrate functionality:
    hourly_temperatures.py
    hourly_temperatures.csv
    Hourly Temperature Over Time.png
