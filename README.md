# Chicago Climate Data Analysis

Python project analyzing 60 years of weather data from the Chicago API to identify long-term climate trends and temperature variations.

## Overview

Built as part of Open Avenues Professional Software Development Bootcamp. This project demonstrates API integration, statistical analysis, and data visualization using real-world climate data.

## Features

- Automated data retrieval from Chicago weather API
- Processing of 60 years of temperature records
- Statistical analysis including mean, min, max, and standard deviation
- Data visualizations showing long-term climate trends
- Temperature variation analysis across decades

## Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas (data processing)
- NumPy (statistical calculations)
- Matplotlib (data visualization)
- Requests (API calls)

## Key Findings

Visualizations demonstrate temperature trends and variations across six decades of Chicago weather data, revealing patterns in seasonal changes and long-term climate shifts.
