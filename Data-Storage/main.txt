Session 5, Data Storage

I continued building the application this week by demonstrating the different 
data storage methods.  Using the hourly temperatures csv file I pulled from 
openmetro.com last week, I used that data set to create a pickle file and a 
sql3lite database.  I created short python programs to familiarize myself with 
the basic functionality.  The first one reads a CSV file and writes the data 
frame to a pickle file.  The second one reads the pickle file and then writes a 
the temperatures to a db file.  The third program reads the database from the 
file system, then does two queries for the time at 3:00 a.m. and the time at 
3:00 p.m., and calculates the average temperature.  Also, I've included a 
screen capture of these programs running.  My future plans are to use SQL for 
my primary data storage and to use Pickle to do periodic backups.

Files used to demonstrate functionality:
    csv_to_pickle.py
    Pickle_to_sql.py
    sql_to_300_mean.py
    stdout.txt
